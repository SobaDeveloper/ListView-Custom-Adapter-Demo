# ListViewDemo
Demonstrates the use of listview with viewholder pattern, custom arrayadapter, and data loading from assets folder using asynctask. Country data is stored in csv format and parsed with Opencsv (http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/). Please note that this demo was for a class assignment. In an actual app, SQLite would be used for data persistence.
